=====================
Interact with the bot
=====================

Once a :term:`Rule` has been triggered, it's time to do whatever the plugin is
supposed to do. Thanks to the ``bot`` parameter, you can make the bot say or do
things: send a message, reply to the person who triggered it, send a notice, or
join a channel.

Testing tools
=============

The best code comes with unit tests. Sopel provides a :doc:`pytest plugin
<tests/pytest>` with standard fixtures; :doc:`factories <tests/factories>` and
:doc:`mocks <tests/mocks>` to support writing tests; and the
:func:`~.tests.rawlist` function to help analyze the mocked-up bot's output.

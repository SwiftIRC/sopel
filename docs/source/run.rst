Running the bot

Welcome to this part of the documentation, dedicated to all who do or want to
run a Sopel instance. This guide will help you set up your instance and manage
your plugins and your configuration.

.. note::

    Sopel tries to be as simple as possible, however "simple" can be very
    subjective, so do not hesitate to ask questions to the maintainers on IRC
    (on the :ref:`#sopel channel<faq-contact-us>` on libera.chat) or through
    Sopel's `GitHub repository`__. This guide is far from perfect, and we
    appreciate feedback to make it better for everyone.
